# PrimalPlus
Contains platform and API specific code written by Primal community members.

# How to use
The general idea is to simply copy the files from this repository over on top of your Primal Engine code and it should work. It's possible you'll need to install platform-specific SDKs/APIs such as Vulkan SDK.

# How to contribute
In order to make it as easy as possible for everyone to integrate the code in their engine, contributions should use the same folder structure and naming conventions as Primal Engine's code base.
